We needed a tool to eliminate that initial friction we encounter so we can get straight to implementing our creative ideas.\r\n\r\nSquareone is meant to scratch our itch but we made only a few changes to the files Jekyll generates to keep it as generic as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\ninstall Squareone from RubyGems:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install squareone\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    $ squareone new project-name\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nJekyll + Gulp = Creative Bliss :). Squareone comes with some defined Gulp tasks which you can modify or add to.\r\n\r\n- Instant browser reloads as you make file changes.\r\n- node-sass for faster Sass compilation.\r\n- Setup for multiple environment (development/production).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nAfter checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.\r\n\r\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nBug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/codaye/squareone.
